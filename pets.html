  <h3>Adoptions</h3>
   <p>When CR paws gets cats and kittens that are deemed sociable and ready for adoption at intake <br> they are generally transferred over to the BC SPCA Campbell River Branch. From there they find suitable homes <br> for adoption. If you are looking for kittens please visit their website or contact them directly at <br> 250-287-7766 or <a href="mailto:contact@campbellriver@spca.bc.ca">campbellriver@spca.bc.ca</a></p>
   <p>However, often kittens and cats come into our care and require additional socialization before <br> they are ready for adoption. In that case we place them into one of our loving foster homes to <br> work on socialization. Once they are deemed adoptable, we puut them up for adoption and they <br> will be shown on our facebook page. If you are interested in adopting one of the cats/kittens listed please send us <br> a call through the <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a> page of this website or via our page on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CAMPBELLRIVERPAWS/">facebook</a></p>

 <h3>Lost and Found</h3>
  <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/LFACR">Lost and Found Animals of Campbell River (LFACR)</a> is a cooperative group with facebook communities <br> that was established in 2012. In 2016, LFACR joined another group of volunteers to create CR P.A.W.S. <br> Together we are working to help animals in our community.
  <p>The purpose of the facebook group is to give pet guardians an online location to post ads for lost <br> or escaped and found animals. The group is comprised of 4000 local, caring, pet advocates who will <br> then share the post, assist with location, and in most cases the return of beloved pets.</p>
  <p>LFACR offers online visibility, equipment for retrieval of pets, and collaboration with local CR P.A.W.S., <br> SPCA, and Animal Control to ensure the highest probability of lost and found returns. We also work <br> closely with other lost and found groups on Vancouver Island.</p>
  <p>LFACR upholds the mission statement of CR P.A.W.S. to promote the well being and safety of animals <br> in Campbell Riber area through education. LFACR also does this through the recovery of lost pets, and maintenance of feral <br> cat colonies in the community. This includes TNR and liaison with other rescue organizations.</p>
